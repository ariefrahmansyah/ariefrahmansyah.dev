## Current (September 2020)

This website is currently built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and my customized version of the [Ink theme](https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink). The source code for the entire website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ariefrahmansyah/ariefrahmansyah.dev).

This website is hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I'm using [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) for domain name registration and to provide HTTPS.

The posts are usually written in [Markdown](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/) using the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

For displaying the books I currently read on the [Now](/now) page, I use [Goodreads Widget](https://www.goodreads.com/user/edit?format=html&tab=widgets).

For website analytics, I use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/).
