## Bio

### Long, 1st person

Hi, my name is Arief Rahmansyah and I'm a Software and Machine Learning Engineer. I grew up in Indonesia and studied at Sriwijaya University, where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My first job after college was as a Software Engineer at Tokopedia, an Indonesia's unicorn e-commerce startup, where I worked on the payment system. I then moved to Gojek, first Indonesia's decacorn, as a Machine Learning Engineer. I live in Singapore, where I love reading, running, and traveling.
