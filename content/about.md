Hi! I'm Arief. I currently work full-time as a Machine Learning Engineer at a [mission-driven decacorn company](https://gojek.com). This is my website where I write anything I want to share.

I was born and raised in Palembang, Indonesia. After graduating from [Sriwijaya University](https://unsri.ac.id) in 2015 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Tokopedia](https://tokopedia.com). During this time, I worked on the Payment system used by millions of its users. Since 2018, I have moved to take a job as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Gojek Singapore](https://gojek.com/sg) to enhance Gojek products through machine learning.

I love reading. My first memory about reading is when I was a toddler reading a newspaper that I sit on. I also love running and traveling. My latest travel is to Dublin, Ireland.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can send me an [email](mailto:hi@ariefrahmansyah.dev) or say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ariefr23).
