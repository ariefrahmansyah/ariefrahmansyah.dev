This is my first attempt at building a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). A page where you can get the answer what am I up to these days.

## Living in Palembang

I'm back in my hometown, Palembang, and working from home since June. Due to this COVID-19 situation, I still don't know when I can get back to Singapore. Nevertheless, I will enjoy every moment with my family. Stay safe everyone!

## What I'm working now

I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer in [Gojek Singapore](https://gojek.com/sg), focusing on building an end-to-end [machine learning platform](https://blog.gojekengineering.com/an-introduction-to-gojeks-machine-learning-platform-108968c85e64).

Outside of work, I'm volunteering as Technical Architect at [Palembang Digital](https://palembangdigital.org), a local digital community from and for my hometown.

## Books I'm reading

I mainly read from my Kindle app and sometimes from the physical books. I use [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6221521-arief-rahmansyah) for my virtual library that saves the list of books I've read, want to read, and currently reading:

## Music I'm listening to

You can check my [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/ariefrahmansyah) where I created a new playlist each month for new music I discover or the old ones that I would like to [listen on repeat](https://medium.com/your-life-your-voice/why-you-should-try-listening-on-repeat-513dc0565dea).
